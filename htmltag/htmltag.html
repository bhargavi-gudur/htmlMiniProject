        down a program to show working of "multiple if" in python. </p>

        <i>Checks if the year is divisible by 4. </i>
        <br>
        If yes, it then checks if the year is divisible by 100.
        <br>
        If yes, it finally checks if the year is divisible by 400.
        <br>
        If yes, it prints that the year is a leap year.
        <br>
        If no, it prints that the year is not a leap year.
        <br>
        If no, it prints that the year is a leap year.
        <br>
        If no, it prints that the year is not a leap year.
